# ngcc validation

This repository aims to validate the Angular Ivy compatibility compiler (`ngcc`). Each directory contains a project that uses a popular Angular package which is distributed with `metadata.json` files generated by `ngc`.

The CI runs `ng build` in each directory to validate that `ngcc` is able to compile the given package to Ivy compatible format.

## How to add my library?

To add your library, clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:angular/ngcc-validation
```

Inside of the root directory create a new project with `--enable-ivy` option set. Make sure you're using Angular CLI 8.1.2 or newer:

```
cd ngcc-validation
ng new [my-library-name] --enable-ivy
```
